🔍 From Data to Impactful Decisions 
Recently, I worked on a project analyzing the performance of the call center at Salla using Power BI and DAX. The goal? Not just to present numbers, but to understand the “why” and explore ways to enhance customer experience.

📊 What I focused on:
- Monthly analysis of service level, abandonment rate, and response time 
- Individual agent performance breakdown to highlight strengths and areas for growth 
- An interactive dashboard that empowers support teams to make faster, smarter decisions 

💡 What I learned: Data isn’t just numbers—it’s a mirror of human behavior and a tool for continuous improvement.

I’m proud of what I’ve built, and I’m committed to growing in the field of data analytics, especially through projects that serve people and create real impact.

If you’re curious to see the project or discuss similar ideas, I’d love to connect.
